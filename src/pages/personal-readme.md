# Personal readme

## Who am I?

**Name pronunciation:** Mejia | Meh ∙ Hee ∙ Ya

### Outside of work

Happily based in the Midwest, moved from California when I was younger. Away from my computer, I love all things soccer, reading about history, and exploring new delicious recipe's with my family. Highlights include: making a bomb lasagna, aguachiles, and horchata from scratch!

I'm easy going and consider myself a good listener.

#### Favorite movies

In no particular order:

- Up
- Drunken Master
- Tommy Boy
- The Departed
- Rush Hour
- All things Nicolas Cage

#### Favorite genres

These are the genres I usually listen to.

- Rap and Hip Hop
- Rock, like Led Zeppelin, Motörhead, Metallica, etc
- Cumbia, Rancheras, and Mexican/Latin music in general
- Funk and Soul
- Classic pop

I love discovering new types of music, so please share.

### Work

I've been blessed to work in different environments (corporate, startup, agency, freelancer) with all sorts of amazing people. It's given me a unique perspective and an appreciation for the collaborative work required to ship something special.

I enjoy writing semantic code with a focus on accessibility and performance. I enjoy finding new ways to improve my work. I'm also open to teaching what I've learned to anyone who's interested.

#### Things I love

- Working with others
- Diving into new tech
- Making things accessible
- Readable documentation and code
- CSS/SCSS and Vanilla JavaScript
- Rapid prototyping
- Mentoring and teaching

#### Things I _don't_ love

- Back-to-back meetings
- Jargon or unclear language
- Being rigid or unwilling to learn
- Accessibility and performance as an afterthought
- Repetitive or bloated code
- <span class="smol">Tiny text</span>

## Scheduling

I'm based in Central Time, so (+2 PST and -1 EST).

### Best times to meet

Afternoons work best for me, but any time _after_ 10am CT is fine.

### Not so best times to meet

Early morning or evenings. If you work different hours let's chat and we can align.

## Learning and Goals

Everything, but right now I'm interested in:

**Writing** <br />
Writing about things in a straightforward and clear way. Fewer words. More effective. This also includes distilling information and sharing it with others.

**New ECMAScript features** <br />
JavaScript has improved so much and it's fun working with new features that are fast, reduce dependencies, and improve readability.

I'm a fan of web components to build things faster. I'd also love to learn how to create CLI tools, progressive web apps, and desktop apps.

**New CSS features** <br />
I've enjoyed working with CSS variables, layers, and new selectors. Looking forward to more features that allow you to build things quicker.

**CI/CD and Automation** <br />
Specifically, GitHub actions, but open to others. I've come to appreciate these tools that increase our velocity and ensure we're delivering high quality products.

**Design** <br />
It's always a goal of mine to build experiences that are intuitive, fast, and accessible. Anything I can learn to improve on this side is always welcome.

## You can lean on me to…

- Give an honest and sincere opinion
- Be a good listener
- Remove blockers
- Be a pair programming buddy
- Help improve your design or code

If you're ever in a pinch, reach out!

## Working together

I'm happy to dive into new things, but would appreciate patience and guidance. Overall I’ll do my best to respond quickly to any issue or question you might have.

I like to be included in the early stages with work that'll involve me. I appreciate focused meetings and I try to do the same. Our time is precious and I don’t want to waste it!

### Communication

- Open to all types of communication
- Response within 15min, even if it's just to let you know I'll get back to you
- I appreciate meetings with agendas and _some_ padding
- I'm engaged and try to be camera on, unless it's for a very good reason

### Feedback process

Feedback is always welcome, especially if it's honest and direct. Any form is fine. I prefer face to face if it's sensitive.
