When I originally implemented AstroJS it was on version `0.20.12`. Almost a year later, I wanted to update to the latest version before I started implementing bigger features on the site.

Based on semantic versioning the jump from `0.20.12` to `1.0.0-beta.36` is pretty big. Thankfully, the upgrade process wasn't too bad.
