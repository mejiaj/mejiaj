title: Colophon

description: A new page is up! Created a new page that I've wanted for the longest time; colophon. It describes how this website was created.

Created a new page using Markdown that tells you how this site was created. That way you can use the same tools and techniques to create your own.

Using Astro made it super easy. I just had to create a `colophon.md` file, start writing, and add it to the main navigation.

I hope to create additional components to make the information more interesting and possibly experiment with new layouts in the future.
