# Colophon

Colophon is a fancy word I'm using to describe how this site was built. This website was designed and built by me. It's a playground to test new technology and write out thoughts.

It's been built with static HTML, static site generators such as Jekyll and Gatsby, and finally AstroJS[^1].

The primary goals are to have a good developer experience and a speedy site that would allow me to quickly and easily write content. Everything is open source and hosted on GitHub[^2], so feel free to check it out.

## Design

### Typefaces

- **Main font:** Aleo[^3]
- **Code examples:** Fira Code[^4]

## Technology

- Code written with Visual Studio Code
- Powered by AstroJS
- Markdown for long form writing
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactive elements
- SASS for mixins and extends
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)

## Future goals

- Prototype lightning CSS
- Use native CSS in favor of SASS
- Add web components
- More automation via GitHub actions
