  USWDS empowers agencies to produce better government and public sector websites. I lead development and maintenance of multiple repo's in addition to management of the actual framework. From advocating for accessibility to squashing everyday bugs, my work demonstrates advanced knowledge in areas such as interactive component development, transparent process improvements, client and customer relationship building, and much more.
