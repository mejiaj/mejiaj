            As tech lead my role involves finding practical long-term solutions to engineering problems while keeping performance and accessibility in mind. I also help set standards & best practices to ensure our work is high quality and robust.

            I work to ensure the websites we produce are
            accessible, mobile-friendly, and fast. We mainly produce work for the government sector. We apply the best tech for the job, some of those might include Drupal, React, or both.

            I was part of a distributed team for a leading Drupal
            agency. We worked with clients of all shapes and
            sizes, across several industries. We designed and developed
            mobile-first websites using Drupal and WordPress. The work was fast-paced and being remote you have to be disciplined, take initiative, and especially communicative.

            I was part of a small development team that was responsible
            for 30+ brand websites. Household brands such as: Rayovac,
            Black & Decker Appliances, and Remington Hair Products.
          </p>

            I introduced and implemented (at the time) novel techniques like styleguide driven-development, mobile-first
            design, and SCSS into our workflow. This helped us
            tremendously in creating maintainable, mobile-friendly,
            websites that serve hundreds of thousands of people
            efficiently.
